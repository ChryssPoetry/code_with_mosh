variables are not available on a global scale, to make a module available outside its module
we have to access the export object in the module which is set as an empty dictionary
export {}
to avoid overwriting one would need to use const instead of var.

scanning a js code , one might wanna use jshint

module.export.log => this way we be exporting an object
module.exports => log; this way we exporting a function
